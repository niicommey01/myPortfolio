# My Portfolio
This is not your traditional portfolio website. This is a terminal-like portfolio website, more because I'm interested in the terminal and backend stuff. 

This was a project I decided to Vibe-code out of boredom. It may be my actual portfolio. A standout different portfolio. Who knows? ðŸ¤­
